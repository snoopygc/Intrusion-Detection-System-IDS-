# 👩🏻‍💻 Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A Python-based Intrusion Detection System designed to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats in real-time.

## 📋 Overview

This IDS monitors network activity, analyzes traffic patterns, and identifies suspicious behavior that may indicate security breaches or attacks. The system uses various detection techniques to identify anomalies and known attack signatures.

## 💼 Features

- **Real-time Network Monitoring** - Continuous analysis of network traffic
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identifies unusual patterns that deviate from normal behavior
- **Signature-based Detection** - Recognizes known attack patterns
- **Logging & Alerts** - Comprehensive logging of detected threats
- **Configurable Rules** - Customizable detection rules and thresholds
- **Test Suite** - Comprehensive testing framework for validation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Administrator/root privileges (required for network packet capture)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/snoopygc/Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-.git
   cd Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

3. **Configure the system**
   - Edit configuration files in the `config/` directory
   - Set up detection rules and thresholds
   - Configure logging preferences

### Usage

**Run the IDS**
\`\`\`bash
sudo python main.py
\`\`\`

> **Note:** Root/administrator privileges are typically required for packet capture functionality.

**Command-line Options**
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --help              # Display help information
python main.py --config <path>     # Specify custom config file
python main.py --interface <name>  # Monitor specific network interface
\`\`\`

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory. Key settings include:

- **Detection Rules** - Define patterns and signatures for known attacks
- **Thresholds** - Set sensitivity levels for anomaly detection
- **Network Interfaces** - Specify which interfaces to monitor
- **Logging** - Configure log levels and output destinations
- **Alerts** - Set up notification methods for detected threats

## 📊 Logging

All detected intrusions and system events are logged to the `data/logs/` directory. Logs include:

- Timestamp of detection
- Type of threat detected
- Source and destination information
- Severity level
- Recommended actions

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify system functionality:

\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_detection.py

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest tests/ -v
\`\`\`

## 🛡️ Detection Capabilities

The IDS can detect various types of attacks including:

- **Port Scanning** - Unauthorized port enumeration attempts
- **DDoS Attacks** - Distributed denial of service patterns
- **Brute Force** - Repeated authentication attempts
- **SQL Injection** - Database attack patterns
- **Malware Traffic** - Known malicious communication patterns
- **Anomalous Behavior** - Unusual traffic patterns
